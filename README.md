This project aims to make it easier for people to compare prices for vehicle repairs among different repair shops. 
To test this repo, open it in your prefered text editor, cd in to the client folder and then write npm i in the terminal. 
To then launch the web application, just write npm run dev

To make the application fully work, the Back-End repo is needed, and the server must be running.
